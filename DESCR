Payara is a Java EE 7 application server derived from the GlassFish Server
Open Source Edition version 4.1.  While it remains fully compatible with
GlassFish and can be used as a drop-in replacement, Payara has several
features Glassfish does not, including enhanced clustering and logging
capabilities.

Payara Server is dual licensed under both CDDL 1.1 or CDDL and GPL v2 plus
the Classpath exception.  It is released on a quarterly basis.
